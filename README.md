# Classifier-to-Identify-Dog-Breeds
Using Pre-Trained Classifier to identify Dog Breeds

This project was part of the [AI-Programming with Python Nanodregree by Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-programming-python-nanodegree--nd089).

# Objectives
1. Identifying which pet images are of dogs and which pet images aren't of dogs

2. Classifying the breeds of dogs, for the images that are of dogs

3. Determine which CNN model architecture (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG), "best" achieve the objectives 1 and 2.

4. Consider the time resources required to best achieve objectives 1 and 2, and determine if an alternative solution would have given a "good enough" result, given the amount of time each of the algorithms take to run.
